# CodeChallenge-Instructions
 
 ##  A simple fullstack app in Django and React
 ### Django views for loading CSV files to SQLite3 and React components for data analysis
 * Clone, download and create two terminal shells in root directory
 * in backend/src run 'python manage.py runserver' and check out localhost:8000
 * in frontend/src simply type 'npm start'
 * you will see with the React index from screenshot localhost:3000 
  
### Technologies 
 * Django backend 
 * React Frontend
 * SQLite3 database- upload candidates from localhost:8000/api/upload-csv, companies from localhost:8000/api/upload-csv2

## Future Plans 
* Add graphing features and customized data analysis tools
* Implement features to boost conversion and subscription while vastly improving UX and UI
